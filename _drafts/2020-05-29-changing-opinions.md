title: I Change My Opinions
---

Hal paced the room. "But that was a different me! I'm not the same Hal that they listened to during the debates! I'm not the same Hal that they voted into office!"

The Secretary stared him dead in the eyes. Hal paled and put his hand on the windowsill to stabilize. She stared him down, and smiled. She stood and slithered up to him. Though Hal's face was completely stoic, the muscels in his neck and sholders tensed.

"Does that matter?" the Secretary asked.

"I'm a liar." 

The Secretary smiled as he placed a hand on Hal's shoulder. Hal winced. "Is that bad? If you're giving the people what they expect and want? The majority of people will choose good. You said so six years ago. We should do as the majority suggests."

"But I no longer believe the things I promised I would do in office are good things. I've learned! It's been 6 years!"

"So you're saying you were a fool when you started this process. To become a ruler. To change the world for the better."

"Not a fool. Uninformed."

"But Hal, you said it yourself. This is what the people want from you. Do you know better than the population? Wouldn't it be selfish to turn away from what the people expect of you?"

Hal slid to the floor and brought his knees to his head. The Secretary placed her hand on his head. He groaned. "I can't look them in the eyes. The people I respected. They knew. They knew I was wrong. They still loved me. But they think I'm still a monster."

"Monster? No, Hal. You were never a monster."

"Can I at least hire the man from Africa? We need his opinions. We need his ideas in our department."

The Secretary hissed. "What? No. You said a little over a year ago that you need the man who is the most skilled for the job. Think of Bill. He's been in this department for years. You don't need diversity. What a ridiculous notion. You have to hold to what you said."

"No. No! You don't understand!"

"I understand your old views better than you. You must listen to me. Besides, if you start agreeing with the other side, you have to go all the way. There is no compromise."

Dumb, little anecdote OVER!

This blog is primarily for short stories and little opinion pieces or "how to's" or anything that will help me practice writing. But you will read about my opinions. Here's the thing. I stress all the time about things I have said before, ideas that I had, things I thought were truths, stupid things I might say in the future, etc.

I've come to realize over time that when I try to come up with what it means for something to be "true," I am wrong most of the time unless I happens to be in line with eternal truths from God. Even in math, rules that I thought were rules for good can be proven wrong depending on what is going on.

This is where I will mention religion. I am religious, and I do believe that there is right and there is wrong. I believe that God is the only one who can decide that. He tells us those truths through his servants, the prophets. God has laid out a plan for each of us, and following Christ through truths of the Gospel are how we return to Him to be happy for eternity.

In summary, things on which I will not change my opinion are these:
 - God lives
 - Jesus Christ lived and died and lived again. He was sent by God. 
 - The Gospel of Jesus Christ and the commandments of God are how we return to live with him
 - The Book of Mormon is true (written by prophets, under the direction of God. This obviously extends to the Bible as well).
 - God has called a living prophet on the earth today, and he directs the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
 - We can gain personal revelation for our own lives by turning to God
 - There is good, and there is evil.

But after those, life gets a little more complicated. We can agree on the things above and have completely different opinions about politics, the best way to raise children, what it means to be educated, what the most important things we should do in our life are, whether English majors are valuable (upcoming post on that one!), etc. etc.

Sometimes, we have a hard time fitting things into our unshakeable truths. For example: I'm writing this during the coronavirus pandemic, and there have been many opinions circling around whether it is good to wear a mask or not. I have a very strong opinion about this: everyone who is able to, should wear a mask when in crowded or indoor spaces (even if we're not a hundred percent sure it is helping). I think it is selfish to cite "personal liberty" as a reason not to wear a mask, and I think people who say "I'm not going to wear a mask unless I'm sick" are uninformed. And trust me, I see red when people try to argue with me against that opinion. I've done my research. I don't have strong opinions unless I have done my research because I hate and am terrified of confrontation and won't discuss things with people unless I've done my research. 

But, wearing masks or not wearing masks doesn't solidly fit into the unshakeable truths that I have above. I can think of some ways that it does, but others can think of ways *not* wearing masks fits into those same truths. (Baffling to me, but okay.)

But I don't know how things are going to develop. I find myself doubting this, and feeling annoyed with even myself for saying this, but if evidence comes out that masks are in fact harmful (again, feel my eyeroll), I want to feel like I can change my opinion. Even though I have stated here that *I think* they are not as harmful as they are helpful in our current situation.

I think (important phrase y'all) a lot of the problems that we have today (particularly political) have come because people refused to entertain the idea that the other side fits into our unshakeable truth sometimes. Our polarizing political parties in the United States are evidence of that. 

So here's the thing. You'll notice most of the above statements are "I think" statements. And they will stay that way. The truth is, I don't know anything compared to everything I could know. I can't. It's impossible. But I try. And I change. And I try to get closer to truth.

So, as you read things in my blog, understand that unless they directly follow the things above that I have stated as my unshakeable truths, they are "I think" statements. Often well thought out, "I think" statements, but "I think" statements nontheless. If you want to talk to me about my opinions, that's great. I will welcome any discussion. But you must understand, I will shut off if you are not willing to accept that you may be wrong, because now it is a confrontation. Argument. You trying to eat me up. (It's an anxiety thing. I've always been a little that way. Working on it.)
