Title: The Dark Forest

This summer has been one of the brightest and warmest in my memory. Smoke from nearby fires had not turned the sun red and muted its rays into a brownish haze until recently. Rain hasn't had us all wearing sweaters until the fourth of July, like last year when we celebrated in a variety of scarves and raincoats. I even managed to get one of the worst sunburns I've had in years and my leathery skin peeled off my shoulders in sheets as I backpacked for the first time.

The heat crept up like a snake, slowly slithering through the spring months until it coiled to pounce in June, leaving us all recoiling and frantically grabbing for our AC units. But until then, I was walking for an hour, every day, by myself. My favorite time to walk was when a storm was blowing in. The cool air dried my face when stray raindrops hit it, and my beloved, unflattering, lime-green sweatshirt gave me just enough warmth to keep me on the brink of jogging.

I listened to Mrs. Elton, brought to life by an unknown British reader, ramble on about her neighbor's grand estate as I walked through neighborhoods of houses that even Emma would think too fancy. I explored the canyon near my home as I listened to Tom Sawyer exploring an island. Oh, how I didn't envy the thick, hot, humidity of the Mississippi river in the summer months. When I started listening to "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn", summer had officially pounced, and I was left feeling a little betrayed, as Jim would have if he knew that Huckleberry had put the dead snake in his bed.

Instead of days between rainstorms, it was weeks. My walks weren't a fond escape anymore, they were headache inducing nightmares. So I stopped going on them. The little time I spent outside disappeared. The three jobs I had lined up for the summer turned to one with limited hours. Parties stopped. Plans were cancelled. Family gatherings became limited and distant. Like a true desert animal, I crept into my cozy apartment to escape the heat. That's when the brightest summer became the darkest one.

I think everyone understands, at least a little, what their form of dark is. For some people it must feel like a thick sheet of black fog, blocking their vision and keeping them from seeing steep cliffs in front of them. For some, it may feel like murky water they are constantly tucked under as they try to stay afloat. For me, it was like being in an unknown forest with shadows lurking behind every tree, ready to pounce. I could see no source of light. There were no stars. There was no moon. Every step I took, I questioned. Every step, if I didn't manage to trip, led to a new scrape on my arm, a snarl from a nearby shadow, or a loud snap from a twig underneath my feet. Was I making any progress, or was I just trudging deeper into the forest? I was dizzy with fear.

There were flashes of light that took me by surprise and illuminated the forest enough to feel at peace for a little. For some mornings, I could get up. I went outside to feel the morning air and feel the early sun rays before they began to shrivel us up like dried, spilled cheese on the side of the road. I ran with a friend. She was kind. She was good. She listened. But most importantly, she also talked. I gathered her stories and cherished hearing them. I even felt capable as we ran together.

But the scramble through the forest continued. Every interaction was an opportunity to stumble. Every quiet moment was time to question the beasts that must be behind the trees. Every moment of silence was a time to question where the beasts from my past failures had hidden.

Just like many other nights, my husband and I sat, enthralled by yet another video tearing our favorite movies to pieces. And again, like many other times, we were laughing until we were crying. For my husband, it was just too late in the night, and something he would have found funny normally turned into a cause for laughing until he could barely breath. I sat looking on, crying because his laughter made me so happy.

We have many late-night experiences and discussions. They didn't stop there. Those discussions and times of hearty laughter turned into a beam of light, showing that with him by my side, there was no need to fear the forest. It was warmth and security. 

But the darkness persisted and crawled into the beam of light like insects. The darkness turned soggy with weight. 

I brought dinner to a family who lives near to us. The mother had recently had a baby, so though I didn't know them very well, I was very happy to be doing some good during a summer that must be dark for a lot of people. I had not seen or interacted with any children in a long while. As I neared the family's home with my masked face, laden with food I purchased and heated up for them, I saw two kids. I asked them if they were the family I was brining food to. They paused for just a minute and stared at me. They were on their way to take the trash out. I couldn't help chuckling under my masked face. The trash bags were almost as big as they were.

The little boy piped up. "Oh! What's your name?"
"Sarah."
He ran into his home. I heard his young muffled voice yelling. I reached their doorstep. "Her name is Sarah." His mom responded that she knew. "Her name is Sarah!" The little girl came and stood beside me, peering curiously at a bag of pre-packaged madeleines I brought.

After some pleasantries were passed between me and the mom, the boy looked at me. "We have a new baby, Troy."
"Yes, I know! Troy! What a wonderful name. Your mom did a good job picking it out."
He stared at me confused. I don't know why this made me so happy. I asked him, "Did you help pick the name out?"
The girl couldn't help piping in, finally grabbing the bag of madeleines and setting down the trash bag. "What are these?"
"Oh. These are little cake... cookie things. They're some of my favorites, and I thought you would like them, too."
I handed them to her with a bag of salad and she ran into the apartment, trying to take the trash bag with her.

I finished handing the rest of the food to a mom I had to assume was one of the sweetest women in the world--afterall, she had raised the sweetest kids. As I walked away, the boy came to the edge of the porch. "Bye, Sarah!"

This elated me for the next couple of hours. It was a gentle glow. I wanted to learn to create my own source of light to take with me through the dark. I tried to do that through cooking.

Though I couldnâ€™t personally make the food for the cute family, I've become more creative in my cooking. I've reached the point where most the time, when I try a new dish, it turns out well. I know how to modify recipes to appease our own taste buds. I worried our upstairs neighbors didn't have air conditioning, so for a while I resisted baking. But they got an AC unit. It has given me the ability to create a fire in the forest. A small one, but one that I created.

That fire, no matter what creativity I use to make it, doesn't always last long. And I sobbed as the dark put it out. Over and over and over again. I could barely walk anymore. All I wanted to do was lie down and let the shadows take me. 

We visited a place of blunt, stone flame. For me, Bryce Canyon is a place of childhood dreams. I had seen it for the first time on a family trip when I was younger. During that trip, a thunderstorm blew in as we hiked in the canyons between the hoodoos, and it was the first time I remembered not being afraid of thunder. Instead, it was beautiful. Soothing. Something that big and loud only brought my family closer as we played cards under the overhang to wait out the storm. It connected us to strangers that were also waiting out the storm. I had always wanted to go back, and this was the year.

This year, my little sister, still young enough that talking with potential future employers doesn't put her in a sweat and any dream is still a possibility, saw it for the first time as we stargazed by a blindingly bright moon. "It looks like ancient castle ruins," she told me. "Just think of the stories!" The dramatic dark contrasted by the moon's shadows created deeper crevices and took all bright colors away. Bryce Canyon was no longer a geological beauty, it was an ancient wonder shrouded in gray and black mystery. It was majestic, daunting, beautiful. With a telescope we gazed at Jupiter and Saturn and watched as stars streaked across the sky. Though the rest of my family saw shooting stars that night, I never did. I was too busy watching them. I wasn't disappointed. They glowed beautifully.

That night, the fear crept in again. I couldn't sleep. My husband slept beside me. I heard every nocturnal animal scurrying through the forest. I thought I heard footprints. I was in the dark, summer forest once again. Except instead of having bursts of light to show what was around me, I was in a tent. I couldn't see anything. 

Then the cold enveloped me. I shivered. Leaves crunched outside. I cried silently. I shook.

My husband woke up and turned to check on me. "You alright?"

"I'm cold." We awkwardly found the extra blankets at my feet.

I still couldn't relax. I trembled.

"I have to use the bathroom." I quickly wiped my tears away. I couldn't step out of that tent. I didn't know what I would find. Maybe the shadows could just take me.

My husband helped me find my shoes and open the door to our tiny tent. I zipped up a jacket and pretended to be brave.

"If something jumps out and attacks you, scream really loud and I'll come save you," my husband joked.

"Don't tell me that! I can barely stand!"

He seemed a little befuddled. He embraced me and gave me a quick kiss and gently stroked my face. "It will be okay. I can come with you if you'd like."

"It's alright."

I zipped up the tent door behind me. Then I noticed that I didn't need my flashlight.

The forest around me was brightly illuminated. The stars provided an unwavering light. The forest was a beautiful monochrome. The moon had set, but the Milky way wove through the trees above me. My breathing calmed. My tears and shivering immediately stopped. I felt warm again. And I just stared, gaping. 

I was completely alone, yet not afraid. I was completely exposed, yet not trembling. There were still sounds of the forest, and things I couldn't see, but I no longer feared that they would harm me. That brushing of the breeze through the trees was soothing like a hug. The little beams of light, the sources of my hope, gathered to show me the way. I silently walked on, awestruck and confident. Reverent, too. 

I may never get out of the dark forest, but I may never have to. There is always going to be darkness. Self-doubt. Noises in the forest taunting me, saying I'll never make it or that I'm crazy for even trying. Snapping twigs that chortle at my past mistakes, making me feel trapped. Things that make my heart race and my head spin. But I think I need to learn to let my eyes adjust to the starlight and let those little moments of joy guide me. Frankly, I never thought that starlight could ever light the way. I never thought that such small instances of hope and joy could light up the world just enough to travel through without fear. Once I learn to find those stars and see with their light, I can feel that it will be okay.
