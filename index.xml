      <description>Atticus Finch said to Scout, &amp;ldquo;[courage is] when you know you&amp;rsquo;re licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.&amp;rdquo;
Great quote, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing. What things are worth seeing through no matter what? At what point is it best to give up? The little scientist in me may pretend to know the answer to everything, but I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to figure out which things are worth being courageous about.</description>

      <description>People respond violently to everything.
It&amp;rsquo;s normal and acceptable to respond inappropriately to things.
It&amp;rsquo;s okay to will people to hell if they disagree with you.
If you&amp;rsquo;re passionate about a current issue, you&amp;rsquo;re not looking at things logically.
The &amp;ldquo;other side&amp;rdquo; has the worst intentions.
Even the most complicated debates on current affairs can be summed up in one picture and one line of text.
There are people out to get you.</description>
